#  Movie Industry Correlation Project


This project investigates the correlation between movie features (such as budget, score, and votes) and gross revenue. The analysis is based on data for 6,820 movies sourced from the Movie Industry dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). 


Our first step is to clean and format the movie dataset to prepare it for analysis. Once the data is properly structured, we will explore correlations among all available fields to identify which factors are directly or strongly related to gross revenue. Understanding these relationships is valuable because it reveals what variables most significantly impact a film’s financial success.



##  Tools Used 

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub


##  Key Steps
- Data wrangling: gathering, assessing, and cleaning data
- Handling nulls with group-wise and global medians
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting release year)
- Correlation analysis 
- Visualizations: heatmaps, scatter plots


## Result

The data indicate that votes and budget are the strongest predictors of gross revenue. In contrast, the production company demonstrates a minimal correlation and serves as a poor standalone predictor. This suggests that audience reach and financial investment are the key drivers of box-office success.
